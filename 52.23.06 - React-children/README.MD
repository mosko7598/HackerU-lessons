lets talk about the key tree.

children (all the element inside the component tag.)


webpack - bundling service (packing all of our files to one etc..)
state (for changing stuff)
props (just get it from the outside.)

state vs props (local vs publ ic)
porps (read only)

setState vs setCounter (what we need to pass to each one)
what is being render in each one.
