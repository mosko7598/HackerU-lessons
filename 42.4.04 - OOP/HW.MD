 please crete the folowing classes.
 
 animle : seaAnimle, pets, birds
 cat, dog, pinguin, eagle, shark fish, 

 think about how many abstract class you need here (hint - more then 1)

 add propertis to the abstract class.

 add interface canFly for only the animels with wings (pinguin have wings)
 add interface canEscape for the animles that can escape. (shark fish can't)

 add function - make noise and add te noise for each animle.

 overridt the make noise function in the animels that can't make noise.

 add validation to the setters and getters.

 add constructors.

 good lock.
