lets use the react extention

pass an object in a prop.

use array of jsx elements =
[<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>,<span>1</span>]

<ul>
{arr.map(ele=><span>{ele}</span>)}
<ul>
const [count, setCount] = setState(0)

webpack - bundling service (packing all of our files to one etc..)

events:
onClick= {()=>console.log(111)}
why we need to wrap it in another funciton?
whats the diffrent between a state and props?
state (for changing stuff)
props (just get it from the outside.)
