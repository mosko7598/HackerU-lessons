react router recap

create page header component and footer.

lets build an imput component. (input with label and all)

{ name, age, ...rest } (what is the rest?)
we can pass stuff that we didn't declare (like type and stuff)
<input {...rest}>

pageWrapper with chi.. (think about how to do it) with the tools you have.

Navlink vs Link
Link - just a link
Nav link - will add style if its active (via the URL)
in the defualt will add class "active" but you can change it in the activeClass property.

router change location.
pass a funciton to child that is in the parant recap

desturcion inside the arguments
no need for the props.
const Component = ({name, fname})=>{}
add delete logic on click

<!-- (add children inside the wrapper.) -->

how if with && and || works (function called on both side will excute?)

proptyps (open console to see erros.)

webpack - bundling service (packing all of our files to one etc..)
