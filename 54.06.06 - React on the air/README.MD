react router recap

create page header component and footer.

pageWrapper with ... (think about how to do it) with the tools you have.

{ name, age, ...rest } (what is the rest?)
we can pass stuff that we didn't declare (like type and stuff)
<input {...rest}>
lets build an input component. (input with label and all)

get the target.
onChange = {this.handleChange}

handleChange({currentTarget})=>{

}

syntatic events

https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html

Navlink vs Link
Link - just a link
Nav link - will add style if its active (via the URL)
in the defualt will add class "active" but you can change it in the activeClass property.

router change location.

how if with && and || works (function called on both side will excute?)

webpack - bundling service (packing all of our files to one etc..)
